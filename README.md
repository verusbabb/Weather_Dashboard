# Weather_Dashboard
Just what the world needs, another weather app.  The world doesn't need another weather app, but I needed to demonstrate that I build a weather app from scratch using HTML, CSS (Materialize and custom), JavaScript/JQuery, and multiple third-party APIs.  That has been accomplished.

## But Wait...there will be more (eventually)
To make this app more useful, I will be adding more functionalilty above and beyond what was required in this project.  Yet to come:
- click a future forecast module for expanded forecast details
- background images that match weather and time of current weather details for location
- location detection so that current location weather loads when page loads (with permissions to use location)
- improved styling

## User Story
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
WHEN I open the weather dashboard
THEN I am presented with the last searched city forecast
